/* Problem Statement:
 Given a matrix if an element in the matrix is 0 then you will have to set its entire column and row to 0 and then return the matrix.

 Brute Approach : so here is a matrix.
 If I iterate through the matrix, and wherever I find zero, mark the entire row and column -1, (why not 0? 
 As if we mark zero than when we iterate again, iteration will consider that zero too, wich is not the goal)
 After the iteration we will go for one more iteration that will set all the -1 to be 0.

 Better Approach : A better approach would be maintain two arrays, where update the column and row that has 0, and later mark all zero.
